        <h1>Wine Reviews Exploration</h1>
    </div>

    <div class="MainContent">
        <p>Hey, wine enthusiasts, have you been shopping for wine lately and wondered how to go about choosing your wine? Well, this analysis attempts to address your curiosity by answering the following questions: <br>(a) Which countries provided the maximum tastings for review? <br>(b) Is there a correlation between the ratings(points) and the price of wines? <br>(c) Do popular wines have higher ratings in general? <br>(d) What are the top 10 popular wines for the price range you are looking for?
        </p>
        <p>
            <br><b>Dataset Information:</b>
            <br>I obtained the wine dataset from Kaggle. This wine dataset contained reviews published by Wine Enthusiast magazine in the year <i>1999-2017</i>. Reviews were conducted by <i>20</i> different someliers on wines from <i>48</i> different countries around the world. There were about <i>100,000+</i> tastings from <i>700+</i> different varietals. The price of these varietals ranged anywhere from <i>$4 to $2,300</i>. The wine ratings are all above <i>80</i> points and are in the <i>80 - 100</i> points scale with 80s being the lower end of the spectrum to 100s in the ranking of <i>'Classic'</i> wines. A 'Classic' rating is extremely rare - in fact there were only <i>115</i> wines among the 100,000+ reviewed in the rating of 98 and higher.</p>
        <p>Amongst the total 48 countries from where these reviews came from, <i>25%</i> of the countries had less that <i>6</i> tasting reviews. So, I was curious to focus on the top <i>5</i> countries, popular by review count and do a deep dive into how the varietal prices and ratings compared.</p>
